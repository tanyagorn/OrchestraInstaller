- Please make sure that are no running or paused processes within Orchestra before starting the update.

- Since Version 4.7.3.1 we don't deliver the MySQL JDBC driver anymore (due to the license).
  Please download the version 5.1.31 of the driver here
    https://dev.mysql.com/get/Downloads/Connector-J/mysql-connector-java-5.1.31.zip
    
  Extract the ZIP file and put the JAR file "mysql-connector-java-5.1.31-bin.jar" to the Orchestra lib directory (orchestra/WEB-INF/lib/).
