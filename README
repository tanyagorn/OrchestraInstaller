This code lives on github at:

This project is an example of how to create a working Izpack 5.x installer using maven as the build system.
I make no claims that it is a GOOD example, but it is an example that works.  I would be quite
happy to receive any feedback or ideas on how to improve it.

The project is broken into two pieces.  The panels directory contains a maven project that builds 
a jar containing the implementation of a custom panel.  In this case I just copied the HelloPanel.java that
is included as a part of IZpack and changed the name to prove the concept.  The "installer" sub directory 
contains the build of the installer itself that packages up the custom panel as a part of the installer.

to build:

cd panels
mvn clean install

cd ../installer
mvn clean package

- variable username, password, servername, port => all DB type is set as one
(if need to be seperate, then just duplicate no. of variable is an easy dirty solution)
- already call gen_password.cmd in processPanel, but still need a way to utilize that value
- need to copy JDBC driver provided by user to folder or-WEB-lib <<< currently has no way to do with original Izpack,
  but there might be a way if integrate with ANT
